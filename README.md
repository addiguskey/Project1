# Rhythm & Booze

## Description

This project was dedicated to the pursuit of discovering new music and cocktails. So often we are met with the desire to try someting new. To experience the unfamiliar. Yet as many may know, it can be a daunting task to discover that 'something new.' This is where our project comes into play. Rhythm & Booze was designed to give the user the chance to embrace their inner Mixologist, all the while broadening their musical knowledge.
